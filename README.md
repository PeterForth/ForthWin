#  ForthWin

A modern forth for PCs in the new decade


A platform born from  Win32forth USA + SP-Forth  Russia ,  mantained by a new community of programmers . 

 
Forth2020

Rescuing Win32forth  heritage  and  creating a new  base of  programs that run on modern GUIs .  

Since this is a new project( to extend life of  older Forths)  we decided to give it a fresh new name and  

we call it  Forth2020  (it runs also on Linux ).



A 2 lane road

We like to program with Forth on Windows/Linux  , Win32forth was without doubt

the best project all arround.  So this is a 2 lane road, developing Forth2020 will contribute

to experimentation and also extend life for Win32forth and SP-Forth applications.
