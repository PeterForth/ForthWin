#  ForthWin

a new Win32forth compatible system , that pretends to overcome the false virus detection of v >6.10

Mission

In the hope to continue the legacy of Win32forth and resolving the antivirus False positive,
we started this new project triying to keep compatibility to it.

Why ?

Win32forth is regrettably blacklisted on the AV engines at a level that is not possible to advance further.
What does this mean ? Today we have any chances to install Win32f on a modern computer without the automatic
deletion by the firewall AV. (+ Win32f is also prohibited to run on any web-servers)
This is not a new or unknown problem, it was discovered over 9 years ago as the antivirus engines started to see
Win32forth as a threat. After much effort from the development community and mantainers, there was any solution.
We are grateful to all the people involved on the process of detection, and the eforts they did seeking a solution.

ForthWin

A change in name for the next project is mandatory, since the problems commented above involve the detection
of the program name too.
As the first option we decided to go along with ForthWin.

A 2 lane road

We like to say this is a 2 lane road. Developing ForthWin will contribute
to experimentation and also extend the life of Win32forth aplications.
