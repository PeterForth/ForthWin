        Billions and Billions of Random Numbers

In 1997, Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura developed the
Mersenne Twister. The Mersenne Twister is "designed with
consideration of the flaws of various existing generators,"
has a super-astronomical period of 2^19937 - 1, gives a
sequence that is 623-dimensionally equidistributed, and "has
passed many stringent tests, including the die-hard test of
G. Marsaglia and the load test of P. Hellekalek and S.
Wegenkittl."  It is efficient in memory usage (typically
using 2506 bytes of static data, and the code is quite short
as well).  It generates random numbers in batches of 624 at a
time, so the caching and pipelining of modern systems is
exploited. It is also divide- and mod-free.

And it is fast.  In C, it's four times faster than the
inadequate Standard C Library function `rand`.  Elko
Tchernev reports 100 million random numbers in 22 seconds
using SwiftForth.

It is easy to port the C code to Standard Forth.

A Forth program for MT19937: Integer version (1999/10/28)
`GENRAND` generates one pseudorandom unsigned integer (32bit)
which is uniformly distributed among 0 to 2^32-1  for each
call. `seed SGRENRAND` sets initial values in the working
area of 624 words. Before `GENRAND`, `seed SGENRAND` must be
called once. (`seed` is any 32-bit integer.)

Coded in C by Takuji Nishimura, considering the suggestions by
Topher Cooper and Marc Rieffel in July-Aug. 1997.

Converted to Standard Forth by Wil Baden, 2000-05-15.

Initialization by `SGENRAND` is an example. Theoretically,
there are 2^19937-1 possible states as an initial state. The
following function allows choosing any of 2^19937-1 states.
Essential bits in `seed-array[]` are the following 19937
bits: `seed-array[0]&Upper-Mask`, `seed-array[1]`, ...,
`seed-array[MTN-1]`. `seed-array[0]&Lower-Mask` is discarded.

Theoretically, `seed-array[0]&Upper-Mask`, `seed-array[1]`,
..., `seed-array[MTN-1]` can take any values except all zeros.

The speed and staggering features make this a powerful
candidate for Monte Carlo simulation and cryptography.

2^19937-1 is a big number, suitable for billions and billions
of pseudo-random numbers.  How big can be seen by writing it
in decimal -- 6002 digits.

A _Mersenne number_ is a number of the form 2^_w_-1.  A _Mersenne
prime_ is a Mersenne number that is prime.  A necessary but not
sufficient condition for a Mersenne prime is that _w_ is prime.
Another condition will make it sufficient.

As of May 2000, there are 38 known Mersenne primes.  2^19937-1
is the 24th and has 6002 decimal digits.  The 38th is
2^6972593-1 and I don't know how many decimal digits.

2^61-1 and 2^89-1 are the next two Mersenne primes.

For cryptography, replace `SGENRAND` with a function using a
secure hash to fill MT.

`COUNTER SGENRAND` or `uCOUNTER XOR SGENRAND` is usually good
enough to initialize simple randomizing.

For best performance, use macros to define ancillary words.

        How Mersenne Twister Works

One way to define a linear congruential series is to pick
numbers _m_ and _p_, where _p_ is a prime, and _m_ is a "generator" for
it.  A generator for a prime _p_ is a number such that its
powers modulo _p_ yield all positive numbers less than _p_.  Thus
you can start with any positive number less than _p_, and
continue multiplying by _m_ to get all positive numbers less
than _p_.

For example, 3 and 5 are the generators for 7.

            WHILE

    6 1

In the Mersenne Twister, instead of numbers, we are working
with vectors of 19937 bits.  In this, the equivalent of a
generator is a 19937 by 19937 matrix that can successively
multiply any of the vectors that is not all 0 to obtain every
vector that is not all 0.  The arithmetic is done modulo 2.
Addition is _x + y mod 2_ and multiplication is _x * y mod 2_.
These are the same as _x xor y_ and _x and y_.

In the program, `Matrix-A` is a value that can be used to form
such a matrix.  The once-every-624-times part of the program
takes this value and does calculations that are equivalent to
multiplying by the full matrix.

This gives 2^19937-1 combinations of 19937 bits.

The matrix has the following form, but 19937 by 19937.

    0 1 0 0 0 0
    0 0 1 0 0 0
    0 0 0 1 0 0
    0 0 0 0 1 0
    0 0 0 0 0 1
    a b c d e f

The done-every-time part twists the output to obscure the
algebraic connection between successive elements.  It's
equivalent to multiplying by an invertible 19937 by 19937
matrix.
