\ File: buildctr.f
\
\ Use:
\	BUILDCTR filename.ext CONSTANT build#
\
\ The file filename.ext (created if does not exist) will
\ contain the build number, this number will be incremented
\ by 1 upon each execution of the phrase BUILDCTR filename.ext.

\ BUILDCTR ( "filename" -- u )
\ Skip leading space delimiters.  Parse filename delimited by a space.
\ If the file identified by filename exists, verify that it contains
\ only a decimal number (no non-numeric symbols permitter) and that
\ its length is not greater than the constant buildctr-max .
\ Read the contents of the file into PAD, convert the text to a number,
\ increment the number, and write the text back into the file.

\ This is an ANS Forth program requiring the wordsets:
\ CORE EXT, FILE EXT, DOUBLE
\ ( DOUBLE is not really necessary)

\ A note for beginners.
\ This is a really terrible piece of code. Never write like this.
\ I wrote one big definition to avoid interference with the application
\ name space.
