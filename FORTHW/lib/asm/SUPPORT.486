If you have a problem with the assembler as written runnning on Andrew
McKewan's and Tom Zimmer's FORTH for Windows 95 and NT, send me e-mail
or paper mail as directed in the documentation file.

If you have a problem with a modified version of the assembler, first,
contact the person who modified it.  If you either can't contact them, or
they are unable to help you, send me e-mail or paper mail, and be prepared
to wait a possibly very long time (could be over a year) for a response.  I
will need a copy of the modified assembler

If you are running on any platform other than Andrew and Tom's FORTH,
I can probably help you, but it will cost you.

If you need an immediate response, it will definitely cost you.

If you are running on a different platform and you need support, you have
to provide me with a normally licensed copy of the FORTH system you are
using.  If the FORTH system won't run on a 386, you're also going to need to
loan me the necessary hardware.  All necessary shipping will be done at your
expense.  Also, I will not install a different operating system on my machine
to support you.  If you need me to debug an OS/2 FORTH assembler, for example,
you are going to have to provide me with a computer to run the FORTH system on,
as I have no interest in cramming OS/2 into my already overstuffed box (and
that goes double for NT!).  If the provided hardware doesn't already have the
operating system and FORTH system installed, you will be billed at my normal
consulting rate for me to perform the installation.  My rate is currently
US $120 per hour, but I reserve the right to change it at any time.  Any
system you provide for my use must include a decent editor, preferably a vi
clone.  If you don't need immediate results, send me a letter, and I'll
write back telling you what I need to do the job.  I won't charge for
this support if you provide the required materials, and understand that it
could take several months to a year for me to get around to doing anything.

If you need an immediate response, call FIG during their normal business hours,
and Frank Hall will pass your message on to me.  Be warned, I will charge the
unreasonable consulting fee cited above.  (My programs are free, my time
isn't).  You will also be responsible for any necessary long distance charges.

If you would like to distribute the assembler in a manner inconsistent with
the Free Software Foundation's General Public License, contact me through the
channels listed in the documentation file, and we'll work something out.

If you want a copy of the latest assembler source code, send me a check for
US $20, drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order, to the
address in the documentation and I'll send you the latest version on 3.5"
floppy.  If you need a 5.25" floppy, it will cost you US $5 more.  You can
also download the assembler via anonymous FTP at:
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/ja/japs/486asm.zip
